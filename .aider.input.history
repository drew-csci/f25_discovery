+Redesign the Discovery Hub welcome page template to have a modern split-screen layout similar to the UTech example image.
+
+Files to edit: templates/welcome.html (or whichever template renders the homepage), and if needed, static/css/styles.css.
+
+**Goals:**
+- Keep all existing Django template logic, form handling, and URLs intact.
+- Left side (~40% width): welcome text ("Welcome"), short message, and the three user type buttons ("I am a University", "I am a Company", "I am an Investor"). Center them vertically.
+- Right side (~60% width): add a tech-themed illustration or placeholder image (SVG or PNG) with a gradient background (light-to-deep blue or purple). The style should match the UTech layout example.
+- Use Tailwind CSS if available; otherwise, create equivalent styles in the CSS file.
+- Use a clean, modern aesthetic: rounded corners, soft shadows, balanced spacing, and responsive layout.
+- Keep top navbar (Discovery Hub logo, Log in, Create account) exactly as is, but align it visually with the new layout.
+- Ensure everything remains fully functional  just update visuals and structure.
+
+Do not modify any Django template tags or logic  only HTML structure and styling.

+Redesign the current Discovery Hub welcome page (index.html / main template) so it has a modern split-screen layout like the UTech example. Keep all current functionality, buttons, and links (user type selection, log in, create account, etc.).
+
+**Layout details:**
+- Left side (about 40% width): keep the welcome text and buttons, centered vertically.
+- Right side (about 60% width): add a large illustration or placeholder area with gradient background (use any royalty-free tech illustration SVG).
+- Use a clean, modern style with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and consistent padding.
+- Keep the Discovery Hub logo and top navigation (Log in, Create account).
+- Use Tailwind CSS (if available) or equivalent modern CSS styling.
+- Maintain all button functionality and links unchanged.
+
+Keep all current logic intact  only change the visual layout and styles to match the style of the UTech example.

+Please update base.html so that it works seamlessly with the modern welcome.html design.
+
+Goals:
+- Keep all existing functionality for authenticated pages (navbar, footer, container layout).
+- But make it so that pages like welcome.html can disable the header, footer, and container easily by overriding the Django template blocks.
+- Ensure that if a page overrides {% block header %}{% endblock %}, the navbar does not appear.
+- Ensure that if a page overrides {% block page_content %}{% endblock %}, it can render full-screen without double "container" wrappers.
+- Keep TailwindCSS loaded globally.
+- Keep static/css/styles.css linked for global styles.
+- Do not break any existing Django template logic or URL tags.
+- Use clean indentation and structure.
+
+The goal is to make base.html flexible enough so welcome.htmls full-screen design displays correctly side by side with all other pages.

+Please update base.html so that if a page explicitly defines its own full-screen layout (for example welcome.html), the default header, footer, and container are not rendered.
+
+Specifically:
+- Wrap the <header> and <footer> and <main class="container"> elements in {% if not block.super %} or similar conditional logic, so that when a child template overrides those blocks, the default structure is skipped.
+- Ensure that when welcome.html overrides the header and page_content blocks, it appears full-screen with no header, footer, or container margins.
+- Keep TailwindCSS and static/css/styles.css loaded as before.

+I want you to create a test case for the functionality for companies users. here is the full description: The tests will confirm that:
+
+Access control is correctly enforced  only authenticated company users can view /company/home/, while other user types or unauthenticated visitors are redirected appropriately.
+
+Template rendering works  the correct template (company_home.html) is used and the page displays the expected elements such as the welcome message, search bar, and project list.
+
+Search and filter features behave as intended  entering a search query or selecting a field filter updates the displayed projects accordingly.
+
+Empty result handling is functional  when no projects match, a clear No projects found message is shown.
+
+Success Criteria:
+All test cases should pass successfully and confirm that the Company Home Page behaves as expected under different user scenarios.
